Good water. The quality of water is an important factor to good espresso.
Preheat filter holder, brew head, shot pitcher and cup.
Use only fresh coffee beans for the grind.
Grind only the amount needed.
Check or change the grind setting throughout the day. The grind you ended with the night
before may not be what should start with in the morning. Especially if you're outdoors.
Tamp grind firmly inside basket.
Wipe excess grind off rim of group basket before inserting into brew head
Begin your shot.
Liquid should flow evenly taking approximately i8 to 25 seconds to complete the shot
Remember more liquid does not mean more flavor. Over extraction produces a bitter taste.
A shot of espresso measures between 1 to 1 ¾ oz, and is topped with a rich golden crema.
End your pour when you note a change in the color, A light or white color indicates that
the extraction is done. The quality of the crema is your reminder of how well you did, a
poor shot should never be used
Three Parts of Espresso:
Emulsion - the "CREMA" is produced when the oil get emulsified by the pressure of the
espresso machine.
Suspension - Particles and gas bubbles that are suspended in an espresso, help inhibit the
bitter flavor of the coffee
Solution water soluble elements

Use the top of your Espresso Machine to keep the cups warm.

two bar towels, one for the steam wand and one to wipe up spills.
