Steam Wand for Frothing Milk:
Frothing milk with an espresso machine is very casy. Most machines (including many
automatic machines) include a steam wand that hangs off the side. This attached arm simply
forces steam into your milk, gently warming it with pressure. At the same time, it adds aut
to the milk, which causes it to froth (or foam).
You also will need a small metal pitcher for frothing. These are called milk-frothing
pitchers and they are available at many stores that sell espresso machines and accessories,
They are a perfect depth for the steam wand and the long handle is easy to hold and control.
Steps in Steaming and Frothing Milk
Fill the cold" steam metal pitcher a little more than 1/3 full or 200ml with cold milk.
(Hint: Non- fat, 1% and whole milk recommended.)
Bleed or purge the steam wand of any moisture before inserting it into the milk.
Now insert the tip of the steam nozzle into the milk. Open the steam valve completely to
start the steaming action.
Tilt and lower the pitcher until the tip of the steam wand is barely under the surface of the
milk. There will be a whirlpool effect, but without big bubbles, and a smooth hissing sound
is heard. If the nozzle is too deep, there will be a dull rumple, and you will only be heating
the milk, not creating foam.
Let the foam build. Keeping the tip of the nozzle just barely under the surface until this
foaming action has expanded the quality of milk that you started with to fill the pitcher to
about ¾ full.
Now drop the tip of the steam nozzle down into the center to finish heating the milk.
Let the pitcher of steamed foamed milk set while you make your shots of espresso. This
will give the foar time to settle.
Four Ways to Tell Milk Temperature:
Touch - very accurate. With practice your hand can tell temperatures within 2 degrees
Thermometer - Accurate thermometers would always be used to verify milk temperatur
In addition, they must be trusted until you can check temperature accurately with your h
and your ear
Sound Very accurate. Milk always makes the same sound at the same temperatures
Hopefully not Smell - if the milk smells cooked, you've scalded it. Do not use it.
Terms for Heating and Steaming Milk:
Steamed milk: Milk that has been heated, with the steam wand held close to the b
of the pitcher, (steaming method) with no attention being paid to the creating of foar
Frothed milk: Milk that has been carefully steamed and expanded to create a com
velvet foam, and the foam has not yet separated from the milk.
Foamed milk: Milk that has been carefully steamed, and has expanded. (same as for the
frothed milk) But when allowed to set, the foam rises and settles at the top of the milk
Allowing it to be scooped out by a spoon.
Pre-flavoured steamed milk: You can steam pre-flavored milk or you can create a ilavor
of your own. Simply, add I ounce of an Italian Style syrup (any Nlavor) to 1/3 pitcher of
cold milk (follow the steaming methods). You will then have a lightly Navored steamed
milk with very tasty foam, for making lattes or drinking as is.
Espresso Based Beverages:
CAPPUCCINO
A standard cappuccino is one part espresso with about three parts of frothed milk. Cappuccino is
more coffee and less milk using foam milk. The foam milk on top of the cappuccino acts as an
insulator to helps retain the heat of the liquid, allowing it to stay longer hotier
LATTE
Consistency is milkier than cappuccino. One part espresso with at least five parts stared (hot)
milk and only a small amount of froth on top. Latte is less coffee and more milk and has periorming
latte art by the skilled Barista.
MOCHA
One part espresso with one part chocolate syrup and two or three parts of frothed milk optionally
topped with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle.
