Americano and Drip Coffee the Difference:
Drip coffee, whether made using an auto-drip machine or manual pour-over, is brewed by
letting hot water drip down through grounds. Gravity provides the force that drives the
brewing, as it pulls the water down through the grounds. The end result is a typical cup of
coflee.
The base of an americano is espresso, which is made by forcing steam at high pressure
through coffee grounds. Compared to drip brewing, pulling a shot of espresso uses hotter wate
(steam), much more finely ground coffee and much less time.
