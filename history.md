How de we judge a Good Quality Coffee:
Coffee Experts talk about four basie compoments that Blend to create the perfect cap:
Aroma- is the fragrance that often promises more than the taste delivers.
Boar is a more subjective quality and refers to the feel, "weight" or texture of the cofTee in the mouh, how
it roils around the tongue and fills the throat on the way down.
Acidity- does not refers literally to pH level but to a sparkle, brighiness, a tang that adds zest to the cup.
Flavor- is the evanescent, subtle taste that explodes in the mouth, then lingers as a gustatory memory. ColTee
experts, like wine connoisseurs, become downright poetic in describing these components For example,
Sulawesi, coffee possesses "a seductive combination of butter-caramel sweetness and herbaceous, loamy
tastes.
