How de we judge a Good Quality Coffee:
Coffee Experts talk about four basie compoments that Blend to create the perfect cap:
Aroma- is the fragrance that often promises more than the taste delivers.
Boar is a more subjective quality and refers to the feel, "weight" or texture of the cofTee in the mouh, how
it roils around the tongue and fills the throat on the way down.
Acidity- does not refers literally to pH level but to a sparkle, brighiness, a tang that adds zest to the cup.
Flavor- is the evanescent, subtle taste that explodes in the mouth, then lingers as a gustatory memory. ColTee
experts, like wine connoisseurs, become downright poetic in describing these components For example,
Sulawesi, coffee possesses "a seductive combination of butter-caramel sweetness and herbaceous, loamy
tastes.

One of the Most Expensive Coffee:
Coffee Alamid or Civet cat is the most expensive type of coffee beans
The most expensive coffee in the world comes from Indonesia.
Kopi Lamuk the most expensive coffee in the world does exist, and those who drink the
expensive coffee insist that it is made from coffee beans eaten, partly digested and then
excreted by the Common palm civet, a weasel-like animal.
"Kopi" the Indonesian word for coffee along with "luwak" is local name of this animal
which eats the raw red coffee beans. The civet digests the soft outer part of the coffee
cherry, but does not digest the inner beans and excretes them.
Black Ivory Coffee the Most Expensive Coffee:
Black Ivory coffee is the rarest coffee and the most expensive one.
From Arabica Beans consumed by elephants and collected from their wastes. The taste of
Black Ivory coffee is influenced by elephants' digestive enzymes, which breaks down the
coffee's protein.
The coffee beans are digested within 15 to 70 hours, and are present with various other
ingredients in the elephants' stomachs, which imparts specific flavors to the products.
In contrast to the omnivorous civets which produce kopi luwak (civet coftee), elephants
are herbivores. Herbivores utilize fermentation to help break down cellulose (green leafy
matter).
